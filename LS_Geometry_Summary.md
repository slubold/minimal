## LS Geometry Summary

[ArXiv version](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.10559). Last updated: Feb 16, 2021. 



This note provides a short summary of the paper "Identifying the latent space geometry of network models through analysis of curvature." 

# Introduction and Motivation
The latent space (LS) model, originally proposed in Hoff (2002), uses low-dimensional representations of nodes to depict complex, high-dimensional dependencies between nodes in a network. 

k_{n+1} = n^2 + k_n^2 - k_{n-1}
