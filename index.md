I am a PhD candidate in the statistics department at the University of Washington. I am advised by [Tyler McCormick](https://thmccormick.github.io/) and [Arun Chandrasekhar](https://web.stanford.edu/~arungc/). Previously, I received my BS in math from Arizona State University. I have worked with Yen-Chi Chen in the UW stats department and Clark Taylor at the Air Force Research Lab. 


# Research
My research interests focus broadly on analyzing network data and models. On the theoretical side, I study parameter estimation for network models using complete or partial network data. On the applied side, I am interested in understanding how to effectively sample from hard to reach populations using methods like RDS.

See my [google scholar page](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Ab-RAckAAAAJ&hl=en) and [NBER profile](https://www.nber.org/people/shane_lubold?page=1&perPage=50) for an up-to-date list of publications. 

- [Identifying the latent space geometry of network models through analysis of curvature](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.10559) with Arun Chandrasekhar and Tyler McCormick. [Code to reproduce results](https://github.com/slubold/LS_Geometry). Submitted.

- [Formal Definitions of Conservative PDFs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.06780) with Clark Taylor. Submitted.

- [Verifying the predicted uncertainty of Bayesian estimators](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/10645/106450E/Verifying-the-predicted-uncertainty-of-Bayesian-estimators/10.1117/12.2304954.short?SSO=1).
