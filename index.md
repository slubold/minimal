I am a PhD candidate in the statistics department at the University of Washington. I am advised by [Tyler McCormick](https://thmccormick.github.io/) and [Arun Chandrasekhar](https://web.stanford.edu/~arungc/). Previously, I received my BS in math from Arizona State University.



# Research 
My research interests focus on analyzing network data. On the theoretical side, I am interested in studying the properties of generative network models. 
See my [google scholar page](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Ab-RAckAAAAJ&hl=en) for an up-to-date list of publications. 

- [Identifying the latent space geometry of network models through analysis of curvature] (https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.10559) with Arun Chandrasekhar and Tyler McCormick.





## Teaching

I have served as the TA for the following courses:
- STAT/CSSS 567: Statistical analysis of social network data (Autumn 2020).
