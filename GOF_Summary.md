## Network GoF Summary

This note is intended to briefly explain the main idea of .   

The main approach, which was explored in Jing (2016) and others, is that the eigenvalues of the $$n \times n$$ random matrix $A$, whose entries are independent, have mean zero and variance $1/n$, converge in distribution to the Tracy-Widom distribution. 

To apply this to the network GoF problem, suppose that we have a random network $$G$$
